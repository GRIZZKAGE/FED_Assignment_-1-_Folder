                In Super Smash Bros., players control characters from popular gaming franchises and engage in frenetic, platform-based battles where the objective is to knock opponents off the stage. Unlike traditional fighting games, the goal isn't to deplete an opponent's health bar but rather to increase their damage percentage and launch them off the stage using various attacks. The more damage an opponent accumulates, the farther they'll be launched by attacks, with the ultimate aim being to send them beyond the stage boundaries. The game features an array of items and stage hazards, adding an unpredictable and dynamic element to battles.
